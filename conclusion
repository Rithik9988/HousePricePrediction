Prediction and Final Score:

Finally we made it!!!

Linear Regression

Model Score: 73.1% Accuracy

Training Accuracy: 72.9% Accuracy

Testing Accuracy: 73.1% Accuracy

Random Forest Regressor

Training Accuracy: 99.9% Accuracy.

Testing Accuracy: 99.8% Accuracy

Output & Conclusion:

From the Exploratory Data Analysis, we could generate insight from the data. How each of the features relates to the target. Also, it can be seen from the evaluation of three models that Random Forest Regressor performed better than Linear Regression.
